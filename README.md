# MEAN Stack Training Materials

This repository contains the training materials for new interns who are getting started
in joining the SEWP Tool Project.

## Getting Started

First, you want to learn HTML and CSS. A great resource to get started is w3schools: <https://www.w3schools.com/html/> and
<https://www.w3schools.com/css/>

After you're done, proceed and start learning Javascript: <https://www.w3schools.com/js/>

Take a look at Javascript.md for some unique properties of the language.

Next, set up your computer with the tools you need: Node.js and MongoDB. (Tools.md will help you with this. )

Now, spent lots of time on the MEAN-Stack-Tutorial.pdf. It walks you through MEAN stack and building a simple blogging application similar to the one on Facebook.

Finally, when you are done, start learning version control software git and github. (Git+Github.md will help you with this.) You'll want to push your blog application onto github just as an exercise and to show off your hard work.

## Important Topics

When you're done and comfortable, you will let the project lead know and that individual will start giving you tasks for the project.

To further ease you into the technology, I have prepared a summary of a series of topics that will be helpful to you as you do development. (You can think of this as a small treasure trove of knowledge and refer to it for the first few weeks in addition to doing development.)

The materials are organized by weeks over a one month period in April/May of 2017.

Here's a brief outline of the topics I covered:

- 4.3 - 4.7: Debugging + Git_CheatSheet
- 4.10 - 4.14: Packages.md + Cron-Jobs.md
- 4.17 - 4.21: Data + Services
- 4.23 - 4.28: Ajax + Promise
- 5.1 - 5.5: Streams + Synchronous-File-IO

Each week's material sometimes also has code associated with them. It's a sample todo list application that is meant to illustrate some of the content discussed. Refer to these sample codebases in navigating through the material:

- 4.3 - 4.7: todo
- 4.10 - 4.14: N/A
- 4.17 - 4.21: todo-data
- 4.23 - 4.28: todo-everyday
- 5.1 - 5.5: N/A

There are also sample exercises that are recommended but not required for you to do. But to build strong skills, I definitely recommend that you try to do them.

Also, I sort of give a high level overview of some of the topics. For more information or resources, you should search around on Google and other great Javascript blogging websites.
